        <h3>Information Collection</h3>
        <p>
          The Expense Tracker app does not require users to sign up or provide
          any personal information. We do not collect any personal data, such as
          names, email addresses, or phone numbers. All data, including expenses

          analysis features. This data is stored locally on your device and is
          not transmitted over the internet or shared with any third parties.

        <p>
          The security of your data is important to us. Since all data is stored
          locally on your device, we recommend using device-level security

          your financial data.

          the app from your device will permanently erase all stored data.
